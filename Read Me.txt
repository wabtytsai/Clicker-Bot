01/25/2014
Made by: Chi Hsun Tsai

Requires: 	python 2.7
			The Python Imaging Library - http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/
			Numpy - http://numpy.scipy.org/
			PyWin - http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/

Open http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/ in the background, full size under 1440x900 screen resolution
Open clicker.py and make sure the giant cookie is visible. Hit run. (This program assumes you are starting fresh!)
Commands: 	P to start or pause auto clicker.
		Escape to stop the program. 

The program's cookie bank maybe be under the actual cookie bank due to the latency of the program that causes time to fluctate at about 3% of a second. The program is designed to be save and always go under (because if it is over, it will tell the bot to buy a building that it cannot afford).
Also it is not capable of buying upgrades and search for golden cookies as of now.
